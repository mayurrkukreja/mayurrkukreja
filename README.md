## My Logo
The logo is descriptive enough for its purpose.
- The " A " shape resembles the Android development tools - " android studio " and also my middle name.
- " K " is descriptive for my last name and reminds of syntax while we code <\>
- The " M * has been converted to a loop like shape that depicts that - a programmer is on a forever journey to be a learner.
It doesn't matter if you are beginning now or tomorrow , until and unless your willing to work. So , cheers ü•Ç and lets develop a community to grow in our young days.

Hope you have a Great Day!‚ù§Ô∏è
